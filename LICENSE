PROJECT MODIFICATIONS
--------------------

This project has been modified from its original version to include WiFi scanning functionality, replacing the previous approach that used hardcoded WiFi credentials.

Key changes include:

1. Addition of a WiFi manager module (wifi_manager.h and wifi_manager.cpp) that provides:
   - WiFi network scanning
   - Credential storage using JSON in SPIFFS
   - Automatic connection using stored credentials
   - Fallback to Access Point mode when needed

2. Enhanced web interface with a dedicated WiFi configuration tab that allows:
   - Viewing current connection status
   - Scanning for available networks
   - Selecting a network and entering credentials
   - Connecting to the selected network

3. Updated startup flow to:
   - Try connecting using stored credentials first
   - Fall back to AP mode if connection fails
   - Allow easy network selection through the web interface

These changes provide a more user-friendly way to configure the WiFi connection
compared to hardcoding credentials in the source code.

[Fork Information]
This is a fork of the ESP32CAM-ONVIF-DVR-NVR-Recording project. 
This modified version includes WiFi scanning capabilities that allow users to select from available networks and enter credentials through a web interface, instead of requiring hardcoded credentials in the source code. The implementation maintains all the original functionality while adding a more user-friendly configuration experience.
